Tic-Tac-Toe-JS
==============

A tic-tac-toe game made for the web.

An Epicodus challenge.
----------------------
This project was fairly early in our program, but represents the farthest raw JS and jQuery
development we were challenged with in class.  I found working with JS in an OO style very
engaging and look forward to more.

If you would like to see this project in action, simply clone the repo into a
good working directory on your machine and open the index.html file in your
browser.
